        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Project Background and Personal Journey</h2>
            <p class="section-text">This project was motivated by the growing challenges in managing water resources efficiently, especially water loss caused by undetected leaks, poor monitoring, and delayed response. Existing systems often depend on manual checks and lack real-time visibility, which leads to excessive wastage and slow maintenance. Seeing how these issues affect both communities and authorities inspired me to work on a smarter, technology-driven solution.</p>
            <p class="section-text">During this project, I explored how sensor data, automation, and mobile applications can work together to improve water management. I focused on designing an application that clearly presents critical information such as water flow status, leak alerts, GPS-based locations, and water quality readings. One of my key learnings was how to simplify complex technical data into an interface that is easy to understand and act upon.</p>
            <p class="section-text">This journey helped me move beyond just building a system to thinking about usability, clarity, and real-world impact. It strengthened my ability to translate engineering concepts into meaningful user experiences and deepened my interest in designing solutions that solve practical problems while contributing to sustainability and public welfare.</p>

        <!-- Problem Section -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Problem</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Water distribution systems suffer from significant water loss due to undetected leaks, delayed response, and inefficient monitoring. Most existing systems rely on manual intervention and lack real-time visibility of water flow, quality, and fault location. Poor communication between users and authorities further delays repairs, leading to water wastage, service interruptions, and increased maintenance challenges.</p>

        <!-- Research Section -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Research</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Smart Water Management App is designed based on an Arduino-powered system that monitors real-time water flow, detects pipeline leaks, tracks water quality using a TDS sensor, and identifies leak locations through GPS. The app notifies municipal officers instantly, allows remote motor control to stop water flow during leaks, and enables users to register and track complaints, helping reduce water loss and improve efficient water distribution.</p>

        <!-- User Survey Section -->
        <section class="project-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">User Survey</h2>
            <p class="section-text">The user survey focused on understanding challenges faced by residents and authorities in managing water supply systems. Most users reported frequent water leakage issues, delayed repairs, and difficulty in informing authorities about problems. They also expressed concern over water quality and the lack of transparency in knowing supply status.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Authorities highlighted challenges in locating leaks accurately and responding quickly due to missing real-time data. Both groups emphasized the need for a simple mobile application that provides real-time alerts, leak location details, water quality information, and a clear complaint-tracking system to reduce water loss and improve response efficiency.</p>

                    <p>The provided Fig:4.2.1 illustrates the Smart Water Management System, which integrates various components to efficiently monitor and control water flow and quality. At the core of the system is the Arduino Uno, which acts as the central controller, processing data from multiple sensors and managing connected devices. The system receives power from a dedicated power supply to ensure stable operation. Two flow sensors monitor water flow rates in different pipelines, while the TDS sensor evaluates water quality by measuring dissolved solids. The GPS module plays a crucial role in locating detected issues, such as leaks or contamination, providing precise coordinates for efficient maintenance. The Arduino Uno displays real-time data on a 16x2 LCD screen and triggers a buzzer alert during faults or abnormal conditions. The relay module, controlled by the Arduino, regulates the water pump to stop water flow when a problem is identified.</p>

                    <p>The process starts with the flow sensor measuring water flow values at the inlet (In) and outlet (Out). The first decision checks if the inlet and outlet values are equal. If true, the motor turns on, and the value is displayed. If false, the next condition verifies if the inlet value is within a tolerance range of -2+out≤In. If true, the motor remains on, and the value is displayed. If this condition also fails, the system checks if the outlet value is less than the inlet value. If true, the motor is turned off, and the value is displayed. If none of these conditions are met, the system loops back for continuous monitoring. This structured logic ensures the motor operates efficiently, maintaining water flow control and preventing potential leaks or overflow.</p>

If a leak is detected, the system identifies a water stop condition, updates the app with both the values and the leak's location, and loops back for continuous observation. This system effectively combines real-time monitoring, data updating, and alert mechanisms to ensure efficient water management.</p>
