            <h2 class="section-title">Project Background & Personal Journey</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Crew Campus originated from my personal experience as an international student navigating daily campus life using multiple disconnected apps for food, transport, payments, complaints, and events. Switching between platforms often felt confusing and time-consuming.</p>
            
            <p class="content-text">This challenge motivated me to design a single, unified solution that simplifies student interactions with campus services. Through Crew Campus, I focused on understanding real student pain points and translating them into a clean, intuitive, and accessible dashboard.</p>
            
            <p class="content-text">This project reflects my growth in user-centered thinking, UX research, and UI design, while also representing my journey of designing a practical solution inspired directly by my own student life.</p>

            <p class="content-text">To understand student needs, I conducted informal research through peer discussions, personal observations, and quick surveys among university students. The findings showed that most students use multiple apps for food, transport, payments, events, and campus services, which leads to confusion and inefficiency.</p>
